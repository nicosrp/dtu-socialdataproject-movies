<h1>Contribution:</h1>

Both group members worked on all tasks together and helped each other on all tasks to an overall equal amount of effort.

Responsibility of Manos:
* Manos was mostly responsible for the display and data selection for some figures in order to build a narrative and persistence to the data being shown.

Responsibility of Nico:
* Nico was mostly responsible for the most part of the code and specific visualization choices along with Introductory parts of the Article.

Those contributions rather not indicate a higher workload of one or another person in a specific area, but states the person responsible for delegating tasks and getting things done.
